# Exit insert mode instead of sending escape
# I know I should technically be moving left
# 1 character when exiting insert mode, but
# since I can't detect if the cursor is at
# the front of the line, I can't block it from
# going to the previous line like in vim. 
# So for now it won't move back one position when
# you exit insert mode.
